Additional Recommendations
To ensure you have all necessary dependencies and tools for checking connectivity and other DevOps tasks, considering adding the following:

Connectivity Tools:
Telnet: sudo apt-get install -y telnet
Nmap: sudo apt-get install -y nmap
Nc (Netcat): Already included, useful for various network-related tasks.
Traceroute: sudo apt-get install -y traceroute

Development Tools:
Python 2: Some legacy scripts might require Python 2: sudo apt-get install -y python
Ruby: sudo apt-get install -y ruby
Golang: sudo apt-get install -y golang-go

Build Tools:
Gradle: Uncomment and include the installation part if necessary.

Monitoring Tools:
htop: sudo apt-get install -y htop
iftop: sudo apt-get install -y iftop

Proposed Solution for ADO Agent:

Use latest Windows / Linux base image to cerate Custom Golden Image. This custom image will consist of all the dependencies, libraries, softwares etc which are required by different teams.

Handleing of the secrets will be through ADO Variable group integrated with the Azure Key Vault.
